# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

networks:
  backend-network:  # References external network from backend compose.
      name: tripborder-backend-network  # Actual Docker network name (example value: 'tripborder-backend-network'; matches backend yaml for resolution).
      external: true
  frontend-network: 
      name: tripborder-frontend-network

services:
  server:
    command: npm run dev  # Overrides CMD; Starts Vite HMR server (hot-reload).
    image: tripborder-frontend:dev
    container_name: tripborder-frontend-dev
    build:
      context: .  # Dir with Dockerfile; Builds dev image (example: vite-project/).
      target: builder  # Uses dev server, not Nginx.
    volumes:
      - ./ssl:/app/ssl:ro
    networks:
      - backend-network  # Access backend; why: Resolves service names.
      - frontend-network  # Public exposure.
    expose:
      - "5174"
    ports:
      - "5174:5174"  # Maps host:container; why: Access dev server (example: localhost:5174).
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
